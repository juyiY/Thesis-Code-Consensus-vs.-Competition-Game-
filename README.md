Code for my thesis on equilibrium-based decoding under incentive flips

# Equilibrium-Based Decoding

This repository contains the implementation used in my master's thesis
on equilibrium-based decoding and incentive flips.

## Methods
- Standard Generation (G)
- Discriminative Scoring (D)
- Consensus Game
- Competing Game
- Equilibrium Decoding (ER-G, ER-D)

## Reproducibility
All experiments use fixed random seeds and matched candidate budgets.
